# ATaggedManhattan

An app that allows you to see a list of graffiti locations in Manhattan. Provides address, nearest police precinct, and X and Y coordinates on a map. Graffiti location data is was last updated in June 2011. See the program in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLnmoUI-xrA&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.

#Notes:
-2013 Grifiti locations were obtained via <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/">NYC Open Data</a>. 	
-The photo images (named after the pages of the app they correspond to) are obtained from my <a href="http://instagram.com/tcburning">Instagram</a>.<br>
-This is a continual work in progress, with notable necessary bug fixes that will be implemented eventually. (See documentation & TODOs for more information.)
